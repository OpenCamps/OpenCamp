      		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

      		<h3>Our Code of Conduct for All Open Camps Events</h3>

          <p>Open Camps is a mission-driven collection of open source technology conferences & events. Our events are grassroots, community-run in order to foster networking, collaboration and innovation in open source communities. Open Camps brings together people from around the world who use, develop, design, and support open source software. Many attendees at Open Camp are newcomers evaluating both open source platforms and communities.</p>
          <p>This document outlines our shared ideals and values. It expresses how we hope to make these ideals real at our conferences and at other events. Our goal is to ensure that all participants can freely and openly share ideas in a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment that encourages and inspires mutual respect and collaboration.</p>


          <h4>We Are Purposeful</h4>

					<p>The purpose of our Code of Counduct is not to restrict the diversity of ideas and expression in our community; rather, it's to raise awareness of the potential for actions that could alienate current members and potential members of our community.</p>
          <p>Our Code of Conduct reflect the values and priorities of the many open sources communities collaborating at Open Camps. We've created this of Code of Conduct by referencing the codes of conduct which often exist for each Open Camps event. In addition to those codes of conduct which will apply to each given event, this overall Code of Conduct spells out the conduct we support and don't support at our Open Camps conferences (both online & in person).</p>

          <h4>We are Collaborative</h4>
          <p>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to create Open Camps and make it an engaging experience for us all. Please remember that all Open Camps participants are here by invitation of the conference organisers and the United Nations. We're voicing our strong, unequivocal support of exemplary behaviour by all participants.</p>

          <h4>We Are Mindful</h4>
          <p>Open Camps attract a diverse international group of participants from a wide variety of ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds. We acknowledge that cross-cultural communication can often be complicated and encourage everyone to be mindful of both the impact of their actions on those with different backgrounds and experiences and the honest intentions of those who may have unknowingly caused offense. Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes would be offensive to those around you.</p>

          <h4>We Are Respectful</h4>
          <p>Partners, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants should strive to treat all people with dignity and respect, regardless of their culture, religion, physical appearance, disability, race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation.</p>
          <p>Unacceptable and disrespectful conduct includes offensive verbal comments, heckling or gestures (both online and offline). In particular, where same relates to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, disrupting presentations/events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are unacceptable conduct (including within presentations). Participants asked to stop any such conducts are expected to comply immediately. We consider this sort of conduct against our values as human beings.</p>

          <h4>We're All in this Together</h4>
          <p>Open Camps is an event for everyone, so let all help make Open Camps an awesome experience for everyone! We do not tolerate any of the above unacceptable conduct by conference participants in any form. If a participant engages in unacceptable conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.</p>
          
          <h4>We Consult</h4>
          <p>If people are unable to work out issues between themselves, please seek the advice of a mutually trusted third party or a designated community volunteer to help mediate.</p>

					<h4>Our Partners</h4>
					<p>Partners in our partner pavilion or similar activities are also subject to this Code of Conduct; and in particular, partners should not use sexualized images/activities/material, or use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>

          <h4>Our Contacts</h4>
				 	<p>If anyone feels threatened or violated as a result of intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct, please immediately notify an Open Camps team member. Likewise, please immediately notify an Open Camp team member if you notice that someone else is being subjected to such behavior.</p>
					<p>The Open Camps team will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance and participation.</p>
