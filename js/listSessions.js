It can allow your team to develop in parallel, enable expansion to multiple platforms, and create opportunity for outside integration. But once you've made that decision, what's next? How do you actually do it? /n What options are there for authentication? How do you reset a password with an API? Is hypermedia worth considering for internal APIs? How do you handle unauthenticated access from a client side javascript application? What format is best for API requests and responses? Should you version your API now, or later? Let's talk about how you can determine the right answers for all those questions, and give your API a solid foundation. Because your API may start out serving the needs of internal mobile clients, or single page web apps, but one day (sooner than you think) you'll probably be turning it into a public API.",

What if we could endow autonomous robots each with a Society of Mind, and what if we could entangle these minds into a society of robots? Thanks to Nerves, Elixir runs comfortably on the EV3 brick, which makes it surprisingly easy to implement Minsky's concept using inexpensive Lego robots. We will discuss the concept of Society of Mind, our interpretation of it and its implementation for Lego robots. We will explore how agents are used to generate and orchestrate perceptions, motivation, intents and behaviors. We will demonstrate how robots can form peer-to-peer networks over which they share perceptions for better (collaboration) or for worse (group panic).",

Typically though, we are discussing the 'virtual DOM' and performance when talking about React. A win much bigger than the words ‘virtual DOM’ exists in React, and through my examples, you’ll see what makes reasoning about functional systems such a treat.",
