And that can take away valuable time and effort from focusing on what matters to our customers -- the front-end UX.   Enter Firebase. Firebase is a \"back-end as a service\" platform that works with a wide array of front-end technologies (web, Android, iOS) and has built-in support for these core requirements. And in 2016, it has evolved further to put growth, testing and monetization needs into the spotlight, allowing front-end developers to create modern, cross-platform apps and deploy them with minimal effort.",

It can allow your team to develop in parallel, enable expansion to multiple platforms, and create opportunity for outside integration. But once you've made that decision, what's next? How do you actually do it? /n What options are there for authentication? How do you reset a password with an API? Is hypermedia worth considering for internal APIs? How do you handle unauthenticated access from a client side javascript application? What format is best for API requests and responses? Should you version your API now, or later? Let's talk about how you can determine the right answers for all those questions, and give your API a solid foundation. Because your API may start out serving the needs of internal mobile clients, or single page web apps, but one day (sooner than you think) you'll probably be turning it into a public API.",

Programming with Cycle is very different from using any other library for web development; attend this presentation to find out what makes Cycle.js so special.",

Given the current climate of front-end JS frameworks you probably found that a few of the 293,113 npm packages suited your needs, but aren't sure which to choose because most things sound like they can all do the same thing. Maybe you sort them by the highest number of downloads to weed out the libraries with the least support, and then maybe you want to make sure anything left has great tooling and community-built packages that will give your small team a leg up when necessary.<br><br>You almost certainly landed in between the three largest frameworks/libraries in the JS community: Angular, Ember, and React. I, personally, cried myself to sleep with huge tears of regret after I realized I chose the wrong one and would have to spend months dealing with such a decision...Don\'t follow in my footsteps!<br><br>This talk is going to examine the three major players in the JavaScript community and try to elucidate their similarities, but more important their salient differences. We will talk about their technical differences while taking into accound the practical reality of web development.

Thanks to Nerves, Elixir runs comfortably on the EV3 brick, which makes it surprisingly easy to implement Minsky's concept using inexpensive Lego robots. We will discuss the concept of Society of Mind, our interpretation of it and its implementation for Lego robots. We will explore how agents are used to generate and orchestrate perceptions, motivation, intents and behaviors. We will demonstrate how robots can form peer-to-peer networks over which they share perceptions for better (collaboration) or for worse (group panic).",

I will show you how to have a working local version of Ruby on Rails with vagrant. Which you can edit files locally and they will automatically be pushed to your VM through shared folders with no delay. When you\'re done working for the day, simply type $vagrant halt to suspend your VM and type in $vagrant up to resume it. The procedure was used successfully to deploy virtual machines to a group students at a workshop to teach women how to code their first database driven website using Ruby on Rails in New York in May 2016.
